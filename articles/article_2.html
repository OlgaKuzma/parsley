  <h1 class='articlename'>WHAT IS ALKALINE</h1>
  <p class="articletext">
    The human body by design is alkaline. But by practice, in most all cases it’s acidic. And this is a big problem. The human blood in it’s perfect state has a Ph of 7.365. This is an optimal Ph of the blood. The blood must stay within a very close range to that, or there are big problems in the body. If it goes like… I do not know exactly the figures. But if it goes to, let’s say, 7.5 or 7.2 (not very much), you die. The blood has to be within this very narrow range. The body’s designed to live, not to die. So, the body does everything it can to keep the blood within that range. There are all kinds of defense systems built in the body to achieve this. The main problem is acidity, not alkalinity. So, the body has certain buffers in reserve: calcium, sodium, magnesium, potassium. They buffer the acid. In other words, they neutralize the acid. So, if you eat acidic food, the body has to neutralize this acid in some way. And it will use up the reserves that are designed for this purpose. And then it starts taking calcium (or potassium, or magnesium, or whatever) from other parts of the body. It has to do something to keep the blood in this range.<br>
    So, let’s take calcium, for instance. To neutralize the acidic blood, it will take calcium from the bones, from the teeth. What does it to do to your bones? It depletes the bones; the bones get very brittle, very weak. What does it do to your teeth? It makes them more susceptible to decay; they’re becoming more fragile, wearing away very quickly.

    What causes acidity in the body? One, of course, is food. Exercises. When you exercise, the working of the muscles creates lactic acid. That’s why athletics get “sour” muscles: the lactic acid builds up. That’s why they get fatigued. So, there is acid in the body from exercise. There is acidity caused in the body by what we think, what is our mood, what are our emotions. Worry, depression, mental stress, anxiety create very big acidity in the body. Any kind of pollution: air pollution, water pollution, all kinds of chemical pollution in food (not even the food, but the chemical pollution) creates acidity; sound pollution also. Any type of pollution that we are exposed to creates acidity in the body. So, is it any wonder that our bodies are acidic? Everything is creating this. Not enough sleep, and I’m sure that all this electronic smog, computers and cell phones, and cell phone towers, and infrared towers, and all this stuff create acidity in the body. Water is the most important thing of all. When our bodies are born, they are about 80 to 85% water. That’s why babies are so juicy. They are juicy. You can see it. But as we grow and become adults, then it’s about 70 to 75% water. When we get old and it becomes dried out, that’s 60-65%, even 55%. And that’s why old people look like prunes. They are dried up. Everything becomes dry, that’s why constipation is such a problem.<br>
    If you are vegetarian, so you’ve already eliminated the meat, the fish and eggs. Really, fish is not so acidic, but meat and eggs are very acidic. The authorities on this subject say that eggs are the worst. If you eat 1 egg, it takes the body 72 hours to clean the contamination out of the blood. 1 egg!

    There is basically only 4 grains that are alkaline and low alkaline (but still alkaline or just almost). They are millet, buckwheat, spelt, quinoa, and amaranth. The rest of the grains are acid-forming, especially wheat, rice, especially white rice. All the refined grains are the worst. So, if you eat rice, eat Brown rice or Brown Basmati rice. The whiter it is, the worst it is. If you are going to eat wheat, it should be whole wheat, not refined flour. But better if you do not eat it at all.<br>
    Some vegetables are alkaline, some vegetables are acidic. Let’s understand one thing first. Sugar of any kind however you get it, in any way, ultimately becomes acidic in the body. All sugar. When it breaks down to glucose and all that things, ultimately it causes acidity in the body. So, to achieve optimum alkalinity for the body, sugar should be completely eliminated or greatly reduced. That means all cane sugars, beet sugar, cane sugar, honey, agave syrup, maple syrup, birch syrup, or whatever; all of those. They are all sweet, they are all sugar, they all form acid in the body. Some vegetables are very sweet. They contain a lot of sugar: beets, carrots, winter squash – they’re all quite sweet. Potatoes are not so sweet, but they have a lot of starch which ultimately turns into sugar. So, those are not the best for an alkaline diet. The best thing is green vegetables. These are full of calcium, iron, magnesium. They are very alkaline. They are very cleansing. They are filled with minerals, very nutritious. All the leafy green things like spinach, and lettuce, and chard – green leafy things. Let’s just say – leafy things. They are very, very alkaline, very good. Dill, and parsley, and basil, and all these things; cucumbers are also very good; tomatoes are excellent; zucchinis, all the summer squashes. Onions and garlic are also very alkaline. Broccoli is very good. Cabbage…Oh! Beautiful cabbage. Eggplant is Ok. Etc. Stay away from the sweet, starchy vegetables. Not completely away, but understand where they are in the scale. If you cook potatoes, cook them in water, and when the white foam comes on the top of the water, pour that water off, and you will get rid of most of the starch. Then the potatoes are much better.

  <p class="articletext">
    Fruits. A sore subject here. Fruits are very high in sugar. So when you eat a lot of fruit, your body gets a lot of sugar, which is acidic. You can say: “Oh, I can’t give up fruit!” You can eat a fruit, but in a small amount. If you’ve got some physical condition and you’re really trying to alkalize the body in the quickest way, if the body is really acidic, then you should eliminate fruit. Then when the body becomes alkaline, you can add fruit back, a little bit. And it becomes such a treat. The exceptions of this are grapefruits, lemons, and limes. Especially lemons and limes are very alkaline in the body; grapefruits: it’s better if they are not too sweet. So, it’s good to add lemon to a lot of things: to your water, on your food, your vegetables. You can use it anywhere, all the time; it’s very, very good.
    Dairy products are pretty much neutral. They are about 7 on the scale (7.1-7.2). But they do create a lot of mucus in the body. Especially, if you eat too much dairy, which often people do. So, if you eat dairy, then don’t overeat, eat very moderately. Some people eat a lot of cheese. Cheese clogs the body.

  <p class="articletext">
    Sprouts are very, very good. In fact, of all the foods, sprouts are probably the best. You can sprout all the seeds (sunflower seeds, etc). You can sprout all kinds of beans. You can sprout grains. You can sprout wheat. All kinds of different things. When you sprout anything (beans, grains, seeds), their nutritional value increases many, many times. You can grow sprouts in winter, when it’s hard to get fresh vegetables. It’s very cheap, very nutritious, and very delicious. That’s a very good way to have an alkaline part of your diet.
    Nuts and seeds are also good. But it’s preferably to soak them overnight, then they are more digestible, they begin the sprouting process. Of all the nuts, almonds are the best. They are very alkaline and very nutritious. If you eat almonds, just soak them overnight and peel that brown skin off. That brown skin is an enzyme inhibitor. It doesn’t let that almond to sprout. You can leave an almond on the shelf for 10 years, and it won’t do anything, it just seats there. But when you put it in the water to soak, it starts to sprout. So you don’t need that skin, you take it off. It’s recommended to eat at least 10 almonds a day. So, there is another nice thing to add to your diet.

    Peppers are good. All the different peppers: the hot ones, the sweet ones; they’re all good.
    The more raw food you eat, the better, because it’s the electrical charge in the food which really energizes the body. The main difference between raw food and cooked food is the electrical charge. The whole human body runs on electricity: every nerve, impulse, etc. This is an electrical spark, an electrical charge. So, the more raw food we eat, the more that recharges the body. Therefore, more energy, etc. The brain works clearer, everything is charged with electricity. When you cook the food, you kill the charge. But some cooked food is fine. That’s not a problem. But remember to try to get some good quota of raw food, as well.
  </p>
  <p class="articletext">  
    There’s another interesting thing about cooked and raw food. There are some foods like tomatoes. Of course, when you cook tomatoes, you kill the charge. And there are certain ingredients in tomatoes that you destroy when you cook it. But there are other good ingredients in tomatoes that you can’t get, unless it is cooked. So, what is the solution? You eat some raw tomatoes and some cooked tomatoes; then you get everything that tomato has to offer. These are the general ideas. This is the alkaline diet.
