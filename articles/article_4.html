    “Nothing will benefit human health and<br>
    increase the chances for survival of life <br>
    on Earth as much as the evolution to a <br>
    vegetarian diet.”

  <p class="articletext">
    We know the environment is in crisis right now. It has been for a long time, it’s just becoming more obvious.<br>
    This is also based on research, but it’s the truth: if you want to do the most that you as an individual can do for the environment – become a vegetarian. <br>
    The environmental impact involved with eating meat is huge: from the destruction of the rainforests to the greenhouse gases to the huge amount of fossil fuel used for meat production, the waste from all the animals. There are feedlots and places where they are raised polluting the streams, and on and on it goes.<br>
    So much environmental impact because people want to eat meat.<br>
    So if you want to do something to help the environment – become a vegetarian.
