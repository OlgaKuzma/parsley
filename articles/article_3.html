  <p class="articletext">
    If you eat a diet composed of plant ingredients, then your health will be greatly improved. But many people think if you don’t eat meat, you can’t be healthy. We’ve been indoctrinated to believe this. Also, people think, “Oh, children must eat meat, they must! Ok, you are an adult. But kids! Kids have to have meat to develop their bodies, or they will not properly develop!”<br>
    And now gradually the scientists are beginning to agree. In one of the major universities in America, medical university, they did this long research, clinical test. They tested 126 000 subjects over 26 years. That’s a lot. A lot of people, a lot of years. And they concluded that if you ate 1 portion of meat per day, and the portion of meat was the side of a deck of playing cards, you would increase your risk of dying young by 20%. This is medical research. 20% you increase the risk of dying earlier than you should.

    Another big argument is protein, “Oh, you must eat meat for the protein!” Again, that’s not true. One doctor is very clear that we should have a vegetarian diet. He is a 30-year cellular microbiologist. They asked him, “Where do you get your protein?” His answer was, “Where does a cow get its protein?” Cow’s milk is so full of protein, also full of calcium, but it doesn’t eat meat.<br>
    But the most conclusive, the most obvious test is this one. They analyzed the human body and determined that at the time the body is a baby, it needs the most protein. This is the time when everything is developing, so the protein requirement is the greatest. Now, what is the perfect food for the baby? Mother’s milk – designed by nature, this is the best. So what did they do? They analyzed mother’s milk. And they found that 5% of mother’s milk is protein.
    But the average recommended protein intake for adults, who need far less protein than babies, is 20%.<br>
    So it’s all a myth. Number one, you don’t need as much protein as you are led to believe.
    And number two, there is so much protein in nuts and seeds, in grains, dairy products; you can get too much, even from that. So if the body is to be healthy, then a vegetarian diet is the best.
