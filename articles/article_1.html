  <h1 class='articlename'>WHAT WE SHOULD EAT BY NATURE</h1>
  <p class="articletext">
    We need to drink and we need to eat. That’s the fuel that keeps the body going. So it’s arranged like that. Everybody knows that. We need to learn what to eat. Our bodies are designed to eat vegetarian food.
  </p>  
  <p class="articletext">
    So just take a look at the human body, how it’s constructed. We are going to compare the body of a human body to the body of a carnivore that eats meat.
  </p>  
  <p class="articletext">
    By nature carnivores eat meat; this is what they eat. So what do we find? There are herbivores and carnivores. Where does the human fit?
  </p>  
  <p class="articletext">
    Herbivores eat vegetable matter. They have a certain arrangement of teeth. What do they have? They have a lot of molars, grinding teeth. They have incisors to bite and then molars to grind, chew, chew, break it down.
  </p>  
  <p class="articletext">
    What does a carnivore have? No molars. Canines, long ones, so it can tear big hunks of meat from the deer, or from the antelope, or whatever, and swallow it. See, no chewing. That’s the way they eat, it’s designed like that.So, obviously, we are designed for vegetables because we have molars and little canines. Unless you’re Dracula – then you got big vampire canines. But we are not vampires. So that’s the beginning of the understanding of what food is for us. Also, in the human mouth, as we chew, there are a lot of enzymes in the saliva, a lot of acid buffering agents. Digestion starts in the mouth. The food is beginning to break down and be alkalized in the mouth before you swallow, and then you swallow.
  </p>  
  <p class="articletext">
    So what is the next in line after we swallow it? The stomach, of course. In the carnivore stomach the acid, or acidity, is so high that it breaks the meat down. It’s like it breaks it down with this strong acid, quickly. In the human stomach – very little acid. If you are healthy, there is almost no acid, just a little bit, way in the lower part of the stomach. That is when you are healthy, which very few people are. But, anyway, there are, again, obvious differences: high acid for the meat, but not that way in the human for the vegetables.And then where does it go from there? Into the intestines. Look at the carnivore’s intestines: very short, almost like a straight pipe. The food goes into the intestines and very quickly goes out; very minimal time in the body. But look at the human intestine. Small intestine: all kinds of little convolutions where the food goes in, absorption takes place there. The food slowly makes its way, goes around some turns, finally comes to the large intestine, goes through it down, and, finally, out – if you are lucky. Most people are not so lucky. The number one over the counter drug is laxatives. The number one problem in the world is constipation. And constipation takes two forms: stuck and diarrhea. But it is not supposed to be like that.
  </p>  
  <p class="articletext">
    When meat breaks down, immediately it begins to give off many toxins, and when vegetables break down – very few toxins. Put out a big red piece of meat in the sun and put out a carrot and an apple in the sun. Leave it there all day. Come back at the end of the day. The meat is rotten, “Ew, get rid out of it!” But here is the apple and the carrot – no problem. Eat the apple – warm, nice, eat the carrot – crispy, nice. Again, vivid example. If this meat stays in my body, it’s going to poison the body, which it does, but the vegetables don’t. So this meat goes around and around and it takes up to three days for it to get out. Vegetables – 15-24 hours; everything moves through. But meat – slow; not good. For the human, it takes three days for the meat to go out, but in these carnivores – just a few hours.So, again, obviously we’re not designed for that: toxins poison the body. We’re always having to fight against this. The body is under so much stress simply because of what we eat. Everything you put in the mouth – the body’s got to deal with it.So nature has designed many defense systems, emergency systems. Extra enzymes, extra alkalizing agents, detoxifying agents, systems to carry this poison out of the body, the lymphatic system, the liver, and all that. They have their job to keep things clean.Those systems are overworked. They work overtime. If you eat the right food, it is very easy for the body. Everything is as it should be, everything is working nicely, and your body is under so much less stress. On and on it goes.
    <br>
    Therefore, this is just logical proof that the body is designed for vegetables and not meat.
